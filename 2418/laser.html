                Here is the full parts list:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M24KHXU/">500mW Laser Module</a><br></li>

            </ul>
            <p>This is the laser module I chose to use. Just in case this link dies, this is what the page looks like so people know what to look for...</p>

            <p>
                The module is very weak by laser cutter standards but that being said, 
                I'm really only going to use it to burn in graphics and cut tape for PCB Stencils.
                Moreover, for my use case, 500mmW is just perfect. I havent tried any other lasers but will update if I do.

        <h2 id="C2">Unboxing</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                This is the box my laser arrived in. (I don't know how relevant this will be to you, but I like to record things...)
            </p>

                Everything inclued in the box:

            <hr/>
            <p>
                Cut the end with the barrel plug off of the included power supply. (Now you have a handy 12V PSU for other projects!)

            <p>
                Strip, slip and strip again exposing the positive and negative leads of the barrel plug.
            </p>

                Solder and heatshrink your wires. I just soldered the plug to some spare paired jumpers which I had lying around. 
                They fit the jack on the WoodPecker board and worked great for my purpose. I also double heatshrinked my solder job
                because one can never be too careful.

            <p>
                Hook up the laser module barrel plug to the laser port on the WoodPecker board. Obviously put GND to GND and Power to Power...

            <p>
                In order to mount the laser to the CNC, I use two 3M command strips and attached the laser on the non heatsink finned side to the plastic of the Motor Mount.
                This may cause some stress on the linear bearings on the z axis, but I believe that it is negligible and can be ignored.
